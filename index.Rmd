## IRBs & Data Sharing

## Vision

- Make data from psychological research as widely available as possible
    - Increase reuse potential
    - Reduce bias risk
    - Make published analyses transparent
- Avoid causing harm to research participants

## Roadmap

- Ethical challenges in sharing data
- Sharing de-identified data
- Sharing identifiable data

# Ethical challenges in sharing data

## [Belmont principles](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html)

- Beneficence
    - Data sharing increases value (good)
    - Data sharing may pose risk of loss of privacy & confidentiality (bad)
- Autonomy
    - Data sharing may pose risk of unintended use of data
- Justice
    - Benefits (and costs) of research participation should be equitable

## Meeting the challenges

- Tension between protecting participants & advancing discovery
- What data are you collecting?
- What risks does data sharing pose?
- How should data be protected?
- What information is given to participants and what are they asked to consent to?

## Who can (& should) have access?

- Public
- Community of authorized individuals (researchers)
- Individuals selected by data owner, repository

# Sharing de-identified data

## What is personally identifying information (PII)?

- PII definitions vary by use case
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) identifiers

<div class="notes">
In the U.S., much behavioral research is funded by the NIH and has at least a nominal relationship to health. So, the HIPAA identifiers serve as a guideline for PII.
</div>

## HIPAA identifiers

- Name
- Address (all geographic subdivisions smaller than state, including street address, city county, and zip code)
- All elements (except years) of dates related to an individual (including birthdate, admission date, discharge date, date of death, and exact age if over 89)

---

- Telephone
- Fax numbers
- Email address
- Social Security Number

---

- Medical record number
- Health plan beneficiary number
- Account number
- Certificate or license number
- Any vehicle or other device serial number
- Web URL
- Internet Protocol (IP) Address

---

- Finger or voice print
- Photographic image - Photographic images are not limited to images of the face.
- Any other characteristic that could uniquely identify the individual

## Examples of possibly sensitive data

- Health related information
    - Medical history
    - Medical risk factors including genetic data
    
---

- Information about other potentially stigmatizing characteristics (situation-dependent)
    - Religious/philosophical convictions
    - Sexual identity and preferences
    - Political affiliation, trade union membership
    - Ethnicity, nationality, citizenship status

## Weighing benefits (of sharing) vs. risks

- How useful are data?
- How sensitive are data?
- How likely is it that reidentification could be achieved, and by whom?

## Risk scenarios

- Reidentification by participants themselves
    - Can be harmful e.g. if dataset contains uncommunicated health risk information
- Reidentification by insider
- Reidentification by targeted search (nemesis scenario)
- Reidentification by mass matching (dystopian AI scenario)

## Challenges with de-identifying data

- Risk of reidentification may be high anyway

## Ways to mitigate risk

- Aggregate or censor sensitive variables
- Aggregate or censor secondary identifying variables
- Stepped access

## Information to participants

- **Do**:
    - Describe how you will share data in as much detail as possible (autonomy)
    - Give motivation for recording of sensitive variables
    
---

- **Avoid**:
    - Making promises you cannot keep, e.g. "no one except the researchers in the project will ever see the data"
    - Making unneccessary restrictions, e.g. "your data will be stored for ten years"

# Sharing *identifiable* data

## Case studies in sharing identifiable data

- [Databrary.org](http//databrary.org)
- [Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/) 

## [Databrary.org](http://databrary.org)

<div class="centered">
<img src="img/databrary.splash.jpg" height=400px/>
</div>

## [Databrary.org](http://databrary.org)

- Specializes in storing, sharing video
- Video captures behavior more fully than other methods, but is *identifiable*
- Policy framework for sharing identifiable data
    + **Permission to share** -> builds on informed consent
    + **Restricted access** for (institutionally) authorized researchers

## Risks of public sharing

- Identity theft
- Embarrassment
- Discrimination
- Data may later become sensitive
- Can withdraw, but can't "unshare"

[Open Humans: Public Data Sharing Consent](https://www.openhumans.org/static/public-data/docs/Consent_Document_20160128_(stamped).005ab78912c1.pdf)

## Specific risks for sharing these data types

- Demographic data
- Genetic data
- Location data

[Open Humans: Public Data Sharing Consent](https://www.openhumans.org/static/public-data/docs/Consent_Document_20160128_(stamped).005ab78912c1.pdf)

## Benefits of public sharing

- Public data as a public resource 
- Serves diverse individuals not part of
standard research groups
- Participants can advance their own understanding

# Recommendations

## Best practices to adopt

- Prepare for sharing
    - Get IRB/ethics board approval
    - Get participant approval

---

- Alert participants 
    - **Where** data will be stored 
        - e.g. in "cloud" servers (e.g., SurveyMonkey, Qualtrics, Databrary, OpenNeuro, OSF, etc.)
        - Be explicit, but not specific
    - And for **how long**
        - indefinitely
- Share as openly as practicable

## Pitfalls to avoid

- ~~Specific use cases for data~~
    - "Your data will be used to study the relationship between X and Y."
- ~~Data destruction clauses~~
    - "Your data will be stored for X years then destroyed."
