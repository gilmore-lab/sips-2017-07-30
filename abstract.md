## IRBs and best practices for ethical data sharing

[Rick O. Gilmore](http://gilmore-lab.github.io) and Gustav Nilsonne

How do researchers ensure that when sharing data they abide by ethical principles, respect institutional and government policies, and reflect the consent of research participants? This workshop will provide practical answers from both a U.S. and European context. We will also welcome participants to share their successes and challenges in securing approval to share data.
